# perdi-o-git-na-areia-remastered
 'Git na Areia' is a game developed in Java using the SimpleGFX library. Created during the 'Games Week' at &lt;Academia de Código_>, the game is all about catching as many 'Gits' as possible while avoiding the 'Zips'. Every Git that falls in the sand will be transformed into sand castles. So, come join the fun and see how many Gits you can gather.
